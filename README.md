## 1. Setup

```sh
yarn
```

## 2. Build

The integration tests will be run against a version of the node and contracts software. In configs/build, you can specify what version you would like to use. It can be either a local folder or a remote github repository. Examples:

```sh
# To run against master
contracts_repo="https://github.com/leapdao/leap-contracts.git"
# To run against a specific branch
contracts_repo=" --single-branch -b **branch_name** https://github.com/leapdao/leap-contracts.git"
# To run against a local folder
contracts_repo="/Users/you/code/leap-contracts"
```

When you are happy with your configuration, run:

```sh
yarn build
```

This will generate a build folder in the project and fetch the repos and build them. Yarn logs of the build are available in build/logs.

## 3. Run tests

After you have built the projects, you can start the tests. Some parameters can be configured in configs/run. When you are happy with the congiguration, run:

```sh
yarn test
```

This will:

1. launch a ganache network
2. deploy the contracts
3. start the configured number of nodes
4. perform setup tasks
5. run all the tests in the tests directory

The tests will write logs to a folder ./out/, where you can look for information about the test run (deployment log, ganache network log and a log for each of the nodes).

## Writing your own tests

To add a test, create a file in the tests directory that looks like this:

```js
module.exports = async function(contracts, nodes, accounts, web3) {
  // Your tests go here
}
```

The function parameters are objects you will receive to perform you test. Here is the describtion:

```js
// contracts are web3.eth.Contract objects 
contracts = {token, bridge, operator, exitHandler}

// nodes are Node objects (defined in src/nodeClient) representing the running nodes
nodes = [node0, node1...]

// accounts are simple objects containing the address and private key
accounts = [{addr, privKey}, {addr, privKey}...]
// also note: accounts[1] is the admin of all the proxys

// web3 is just Web3 contected to the ganache network
web3 = Web3
```

## Start local environment for development

### Start default / vanilla Leap network

```sh
yarn start
```

This will launch a local Leap Network for you: Ganache as a root chain with Leap contracts deployed and leap-node with JSON RPC.

### Start flavoured Leap Network

In `tests/recipies` you can see possible recipies to run against the local network. Each recipe prepares the environment for a particular purpose â€” sets up required tokens, makes deposits etc.

To start a network with recipe:

```sh
yarn start <recipe>
```

E.g. `yarn start planetA` to start a local network for Planet A project.

Alternatively, you can start vanilla leap network and then apply a recipe with `yarn apply planetA`.
